zkREX is an omnichain, privacy-preserving compliance layer for real-world assets. It transforms user identity and real-world data into zero-knowledge eligibility proofs that can be verified across chains without exposing private information.

Users verify themselves through vouch/vLayer Web Proofs (e.g., age, residency, financial data, sanctions checks) and combine these with Self Protocol’s onchain identity disclosures (e.g., “over 18”, “not on OFAC”, “resident in allowed jurisdiction”). zkREX compresses these verifications into a unified ZK eligibility proof using vLayer’s Prover Server, then stores the user’s identity commitment in Self Protocol’s Merkle tree.

With the Ethereum Interop Layer (EIL SDK), zkREX turns this identity commitment into an omnichain compliance passport: any RWA application on any L2 can instantly verify whether a user is legally eligible to interact with a tokenized asset—without ever seeing personal data.

Instead of off-chain KYC or wallet whitelists, zkREX enables onchain, portable, privacy-preserving compliance that follows the user across chains and across RWA applications. This creates a universal “zk regulatory layer” that DSX Association can use as a plug-and-play compliance module for tokenized securities, bonds, and real-world assets.
